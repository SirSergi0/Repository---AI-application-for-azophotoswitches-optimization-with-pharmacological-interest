 - $IC_{50}$ = *Half maximal inhibitory concentration is a measure of the potency of a substance in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function. $IC_{50}$ is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance (e.g. drug) is needed to inhibit, in vitro, a given biological process or biological component by $50\%$. The biological component could be an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microbe. $IC_{50}$ values are typically expressed as molar concentration.*\
 For this project, we aim to identify substances with the lowest possible $IC_{50}$, as our goal is to minimize the presence of foreign substances in the living organism.
