This chapter focuses on the molecular mechanism of action (MMoA) in drug discovery. MMoA of a medicine is the connection of the molecular interactions between the therapeutic treatment and the biological target that yields the physiological response. Mechanism-based toxicity is a potential concern with most human targets. MMoAs provide the means to minimize the mechanism-based toxicity while retaining the desired response. Competition with endogenous effectors, uncompetitive inhibition, partial agonism, functional selectivity, and allosteric partial antagonism are mechanisms in which the physiological environment can help to shape the dose–response curves to minimize mechanism-based toxicity while retaining sufficient drug efficacy. Fast kinetics can minimize mechanism-based toxicity by enabling equilibrium competition that may be advantageous if sufficient efficacy can be maintained. This is exemplified by a number of medicines including atypical antipsychotics working through the D2 receptor, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. A challenge for medicinal chemists is that many of the molecular interactions that contribute to binding kinetics and MMoA are dynamic, involving structural movements and conformational rearrangements. Some insights are provided by studies with influenza B neuraminidase, which reveals rotations in residues important for binding, and the enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (InhA), which shows a loop ordering involved in the slow kinetics.}

Let Wn,k be the set of connected n-vertex graphs with clique number k. In this work we characterize the graphs from Wn,k with extremal (maximal and minimal) Zagreb indices, and determine the values of corresponding indices.}

The mathematical background of this index is also well elaborated. We now point out a hitherto unnoticed feature of RG, namely its connection with the degree-based information content of a (molecular) graph. This connection is based on the linear correlation betweenRG and the logarithm of the multiplicative version of the Randić index.}
