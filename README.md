# Repository: AI Application for Azophotoswitches Optimization with Pharmacological Interest

In this work, we propose the development of specialized software in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), designed specifically for the discovery and optimization of azophotoswitches. Azophotoswitches are molecules that can undergo reversible changes in structure and function in response to light, making them valuable in applications ranging from molecular devices to advanced materials and medical therapies.

The proposed AI-driven software will leverage cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and data-driven techniques to facilitate the identification and prediction of new azophotoswitches with desired properties. By analyzing vast datasets of molecular structures, photochemical behaviors, and functional performance, the AI system aims to streamline the traditionally labor-intensive process of discovering these compounds. This approach will not only enhance the efficiency of the research but also expand the possibilities for designing azophotoswitches with novel functionalities, opening up new pathways in materials science and photopharmacology.

## Comments and Features of the Project

Comments will be added throughout the project's development. This list may not be updated regularly.

### General Guidelines

- For any problems or questions, please use the **_Issues_** and **_Discussions_** sections.
- To maintain order and organization, visitors are requested to locate all requests, inquiries, and issues in the appropriate sections.

### Diary

- The file called `Diary.md` will be the roadmap for the project. This file will keep track of all the main appointments and meetings of the project. Also the key point of each event will be stored there and a little summary of each the discussions.
- This file will always be on the main repository and will have regular updates.

### Manuscript

- The manuscript in PDF format will always be placed in the `Manuscript` directory and will be named `manuscript.pdf`.
- All references are located in the `Manuscript/references.bib` file. Although not all references may appear in the final manuscript, they will be stored there to keep track of all consulted files, books, websites, etc.
