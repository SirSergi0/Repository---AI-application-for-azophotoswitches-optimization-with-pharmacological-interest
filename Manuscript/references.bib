	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed pharmacological research through machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These advancements have greatly influenced drug discovery, development, and precision medicine. AI algorithms analyze vast biomedical data identifying potential drug targets, predicting efficacy, and optimizing lead compounds. AI has diverse applications in pharmacological research, including target identification, drug repurposing, virtual screening, de novo drug design, toxicity prediction, and personalized medicine. AI improves patient selection, trial design, and real-time data analysis in clinical trials, leading to enhanced safety and efficacy outcomes. Post-marketing surveillance utilizes AI-based systems to monitor adverse events, detect drug interactions, and support pharmacovigilance efforts. Machine learning models extract patterns from complex datasets, enabling accurate predictions and informed decision-making, thus accelerating drug discovery. Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), excels in image analysis, aiding biomarker identification and optimizing drug formulation. Natural language processing facilitates the mining and analysis of scientific literature, unlocking valuable insights and information. However, the adoption of AI in pharmacological research raises ethical considerations. Ensuring data privacy and security, addressing algorithm bias and transparency, obtaining informed consent, and maintaining human oversight in decision-making are crucial ethical concerns. The responsible deployment of AI necessitates robust frameworks and regulations. The future of AI in pharmacological research is promising, with integration with emerging technologies like genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics offering the potential for personalized medicine and targeted therapies. Collaboration among academia, industry, and regulatory bodies is essential for the ethical implementation of AI in drug discovery and development. Continuous research and development in AI techniques and comprehensive training programs will empower scientists and healthcare professionals to fully exploit AI's potential, leading to improved patient outcomes and innovative pharmacological interventions.},

	abstract = {<p>Leukotrienes (LTs) are pro-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid (AA), and their high production has been reported in multiple allergic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disorders. The biological synthesis of leukotrienes is instigated by transfer of AA to 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) <italic>via</italic> the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). Suppression of FLAP can inhibit LT production at the earliest level, providing relief to patients requiring anti-leukotriene therapy. Over the last 3 decades, several FLAP modulators have been synthesized and pharmacologically tested, but none of them could be able to reach the market. Therefore, it is highly desirable to unveil the structural requirement of FLAP modulators. Here, in this study, supervised machine learning techniques and molecular modeling strategies are adapted to vaticinate the important 2D and 3D anti-inflammatory properties of structurally diverse FLAP inhibitors, respectively. For this purpose, multiple machine learning classification models have been developed to reveal the most relevant 2D features. Furthermore, to probe the 3D molecular basis of interaction of diverse anti-inflammatory compounds with FLAP, molecular docking studies were executed. By using the most probable binding poses from docking studies, the GRIND model was developed, which indicated the positive contribution of four hydrophobic, two hydrogen bond acceptor, and two shape-based features at certain distances from each other towards the inhibitory potency of FLAP modulators. Collectively, this study sheds light on important two-dimensional and three-dimensional structural requirements of FLAP modulators that can potentially guide the development of more potent chemotypes for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.</p>},

ABSTRACT = {Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) and quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) are established techniques to relate endpoints to molecular features. We present the Alvascience software suite that takes care of the whole QSAR/QSPR workflow necessary to use models to predict endpoints for untested molecules. The first step, data curation, is covered by alvaMolecule. Features such as molecular descriptors and fingerprints are generated by using alvaDesc. Models are built and validated with alvaModel. The models can then be deployed and used on new molecules by using alvaRunner. We use these software tools on a real case scenario to predict the blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The resulting predictive models have accuracy equal or greater than 0.8. The models are bundled in an alvaRunner project available on the Alvascience website.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the molecular mechanism of action (MMoA) in drug discovery. MMoA of a medicine is the connection of the molecular interactions between the therapeutic treatment and the biological target that yields the physiological response. Mechanism-based toxicity is a potential concern with most human targets. MMoAs provide the means to minimize the mechanism-based toxicity while retaining the desired response. Competition with endogenous effectors, uncompetitive inhibition, partial agonism, functional selectivity, and allosteric partial antagonism are mechanisms in which the physiological environment can help to shape the dose‚Äìresponse curves to minimize mechanism-based toxicity while retaining sufficient drug efficacy. Fast kinetics can minimize mechanism-based toxicity by enabling equilibrium competition that may be advantageous if sufficient efficacy can be maintained. This is exemplified by a number of medicines including atypical antipsychotics working through the D2 receptor, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. A challenge for medicinal chemists is that many of the molecular interactions that contribute to binding kinetics and MMoA are dynamic, involving structural movements and conformational rearrangements. Some insights are provided by studies with influenza B neuraminidase, which reveals rotations in residues important for binding, and the enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (InhA), which shows a loop ordering involved in the slow kinetics.}
