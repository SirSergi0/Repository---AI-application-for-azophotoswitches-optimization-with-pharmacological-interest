	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed pharmacological research through machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These advancements have greatly influenced drug discovery, development, and precision medicine. AI algorithms analyze vast biomedical data identifying potential drug targets, predicting efficacy, and optimizing lead compounds. AI has diverse applications in pharmacological research, including target identification, drug repurposing, virtual screening, de novo drug design, toxicity prediction, and personalized medicine. AI improves patient selection, trial design, and real-time data analysis in clinical trials, leading to enhanced safety and efficacy outcomes. Post-marketing surveillance utilizes AI-based systems to monitor adverse events, detect drug interactions, and support pharmacovigilance efforts. Machine learning models extract patterns from complex datasets, enabling accurate predictions and informed decision-making, thus accelerating drug discovery. Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), excels in image analysis, aiding biomarker identification and optimizing drug formulation. Natural language processing facilitates the mining and analysis of scientific literature, unlocking valuable insights and information. However, the adoption of AI in pharmacological research raises ethical considerations. Ensuring data privacy and security, addressing algorithm bias and transparency, obtaining informed consent, and maintaining human oversight in decision-making are crucial ethical concerns. The responsible deployment of AI necessitates robust frameworks and regulations. The future of AI in pharmacological research is promising, with integration with emerging technologies like genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics offering the potential for personalized medicine and targeted therapies. Collaboration among academia, industry, and regulatory bodies is essential for the ethical implementation of AI in drug discovery and development. Continuous research and development in AI techniques and comprehensive training programs will empower scientists and healthcare professionals to fully exploit AI's potential, leading to improved patient outcomes and innovative pharmacological interventions.},

	abstract = {<p>Leukotrienes (LTs) are pro-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid (AA), and their high production has been reported in multiple allergic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disorders. The biological synthesis of leukotrienes is instigated by transfer of AA to 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) <italic>via</italic> the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). Suppression of FLAP can inhibit LT production at the earliest level, providing relief to patients requiring anti-leukotriene therapy. Over the last 3 decades, several FLAP modulators have been synthesized and pharmacologically tested, but none of them could be able to reach the market. Therefore, it is highly desirable to unveil the structural requirement of FLAP modulators. Here, in this study, supervised machine learning techniques and molecular modeling strategies are adapted to vaticinate the important 2D and 3D anti-inflammatory properties of structurally diverse FLAP inhibitors, respectively. For this purpose, multiple machine learning classification models have been developed to reveal the most relevant 2D features. Furthermore, to probe the 3D molecular basis of interaction of diverse anti-inflammatory compounds with FLAP, molecular docking studies were executed. By using the most probable binding poses from docking studies, the GRIND model was developed, which indicated the positive contribution of four hydrophobic, two hydrogen bond acceptor, and two shape-based features at certain distances from each other towards the inhibitory potency of FLAP modulators. Collectively, this study sheds light on important two-dimensional and three-dimensional structural requirements of FLAP modulators that can potentially guide the development of more potent chemotypes for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.</p>},
