## Seminars of Research Porjects Methology

*Comment*: A course for manegging bibliography and learning writting skills. Irrellevant but it scores a hole point of the project's mark.

Although the course may be usefull for Students with a TFG developed in a lab, it seems pointless in our case.

For those how might concern, the project (script) will remain in stand by until we gain access to a molecular descriptor software calculator. Ideally something as AlvaDesc Python (arrangements are being made)...

End of the stand by period. We have access to AlvaDesc and it seems to work.
